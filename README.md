# cloth-shop-prototype
A simple prototype of a clothing store for a simulation game. The idea is to build a base system that can be expanded as new visuals are created by artists.

Features
- shopkeeper interaction, 
- buying/selling items, 
- the ability to equip purchased outfits, and see on the character.
