# cloth-shop-prototype
A simple prototype of a clothing store for a simulation game. The idea is to build a base system that can be expanded as new visuals are created by artists, in addition to having a simple way to add and create these items in the engine that does not involve a programmer having to create them manually on a case-by-case basis.
